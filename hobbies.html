        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            As a software developer, I have to have a fascination with
            technology and computers, and so I believe it only makes sense that
            I have a hobby of playing video games. Specifically FPS', not
            including Call of Duty, Im talking about Rainbow Six Siege, A game
            where you need not only gun skill but also to outsmart your
            opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
            If im not playing a game then youll probably find me taking care of
            one of my four cats, Tootie, Alex, Noona, and Begura, or my dog,
            Hades. Else im probably trying to learn how to take care of plants,
            as we just got a new strawberry and tomato plant.
